		<h3>CRM Automation Project</h3>

		<p>I started this project with MDM in early 2021. They were looking to automate more of their worklows and to increase revenue through email campaigns. We first created a CRM system that tracked and attributed all lead sources.
		<br>
		<br>
		Once these sytems were established and tested, we then created a number of different campaigns to help drive accounts opened. These campaigns included lead nurturing journeys, newsletters, trigger emails (e.g. 'Thank You for Signing Up' messages.), transactional emails, ad hoc emails, etc.
		<br>
		<br>
		Results were that email attributable month-over-month accounts opened increased 35% from over a 7 month period. The programming languages I used for this project were SQL, Javascript, HTML and CSS. As well as using back-end technologies such as AWS and MySql for data management.
		<br>
		<br>
		The client had the ability to view all their data from within the CRM via reports, trend data, and add notes.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this project for 7 months before handing off the project to the client's in-house team. I'm currently working on improving CRM systems for other companies.</p>
